TODO Application

Overview

This is a monolithic web application that follows Clean Architecture principles. It is built with modern best practices, leveraging C#, MSSQL, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Docker. The backend implements CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) for better separation of concerns and scalability.
