# Advanced Todo Application

## üéØ Overview

This is a personal project developed to demonstrate modern web development best practices and enterprise-level architecture patterns. While it may seem like "just another todo app" on the surface, this implementation showcases professional software development techniques, clean architecture, and industry-standard practices that would be found in large-scale applications.

## üí° Purpose

The primary goal of this project is to serve as a comprehensive example of:
- Clean Architecture implementation in a full-stack application
- Modern web development best practices
- Enterprise-level application structure
- Production-ready code organization
- Scalable and maintainable software design

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Technology Stack
